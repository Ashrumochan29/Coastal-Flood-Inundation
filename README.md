# Coastal-Flood-Inundation
This framework combines components for real-time reservoir inflow forecasting, reservoir outflow forecasting based on rule curves, storm-tide forecasting using hydrodynamic and machine learning models, and flood inundation forecasting with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model. 
This MATLAB script implements Cumulative Distribution Function Transformation (CDFt) for bias correction of simulated data using observed and future projection datasets. The code computes empirical CDFs manually, applies bias correction, and visualizes the results through probability density functions (PDFs) and empirical CDF plots. It does not require any external toolboxes, making it compatible with any MATLAB version. To use, define the observed, simulated, and future datasets, set the number of data points (n), and run the script.
